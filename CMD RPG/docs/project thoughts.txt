Tests 0.1
	Create tasks to test stuff

Inventory 0.1.1
	Test functionality added in Inventory 0.1
	Correct necessary things

Log 0.2
	writeLine method improvement
		Create a vector of arguments based on the number of arguments
		Call another method passing as parameters the string and the vector
		The new method shall be called by all writeLine methods
	Implement writeLine's 2 override

	Test any new functionality

Log 0.3
	writeLine override that receives an undefined number of arguments (variadic??)
	Search how to check if a std::string has a substring
	Also, create a more efficient way to replace a substring with another one

	Test any new functionality

Log 0.4
	Check out how TheCherno is doing his log class and get some ideas from it

	Test any new functionality

Game Tick
	Create timer through which the game runs - 100ms
		Everything must be executed during this time
		If stuff is completed before this time, wait until 100ms have passed
		But stuff can take longer to run, if needed (try to optimize code in this case)

		Weapons
		Armours
		Accessories
		Consumable
		Others
	NPC
		Equipment - List of items the player has equipped
		
	Mechanics
		Combat - Think of a initial system and how this could work nicely
			Implement, improve and repeat until I have a solid combat system
			Fight each other
			Search other NPC inventory
			Loot any item the NPC could have

		Items
			Materials
				Ores
				Gems			
				Wood
				Herbs
				
			Food
				Fish	
				Meat
				Fruits and Veggies
				Misc
				
			Mounts
			
		NPC
			agressive - will the monster attack the player without reason
			attackPoints - how much damage the NPC deals based on combatLevel, equipment, enchantments
			combatLevel - basic player level. Player will be able to access better areas, equip better items, deal more damage
			
			coinPouch - holds the NPC coins
			zenirPouch - holds the NPC zenirs
			
			addCoins(int[] newCoins) - Receive an array of all types of coins and adds it to the NPC coinPouch. Does verification if a type surpassed the 1000 threshold and transform into next tier
				int[] newCoins = 
				{
					nCopper = 512;
					nSilver = 25;
					nGold = 2;
					nPlatinum = 0;
					nMithril = 0;
					nAdamantium = 0;
				}
				
			removeCoins(int[] newCoins) - Similar to add coins, but removes them
			addZenir(int[] newZenirs) - Similar to add coins
			removeZenir(int[] newZenirs) - Similar to add zenirs, but removes them
			
		Level - gained by adquiring experience points
			Combat - Experience can be adquired by killing monsters and completing quests
				Melee Attack
				Melee Strength
				
				Ranged Attack
				Ranged Strength
				
				Magic Attack
				Ranged Strength
				
				Defence
			
			Crafting
			
		Currency
			nextTierThreshold = 1000;
			
			Many types of currency, and divided between coins and zenirs. Coins are less valuable and zenirs are extremely valuable ( don't really know if someone is going to adquire one someday )
			
			Must have 1000 of a currency to go to the next tier - 1000 copper coins will turn into 1 silver coin
			
			Coins
				Copper
				Silver
				Gold
				Platinum
				Mithril
				Adamantium
				
			Zenir
				Sapphire
				Emerald
				Ruby
				Diamond
				
			Ideas to consider
				A zenir is made with shards - To make a Sapphire zenir, you must use a powerfull magic to fuse 100 sapphire shards into 1 zenir
				Increase maximum number of coins before going to the next tier
				Create a third and even greater tier
